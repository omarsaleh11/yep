     <p><span><strong>The praying mantis is named for</strong></span> its prominent front legs, which are
      bent and held together at an angle that suggests the
      position of prayer. <sup>(1)</sup></p>

     <p>By any name, <span><strong>these fascinating insects are formidable predators</strong></span>.
      They have
      triangular heads poised on a long "neck," or
      elongated thorax. <sup>(1)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Mantids can turn their heads 180 degrees to</strong></span> scan their surroundings
      with two
      large compound eyes and three other simple
      eyes located between them. <sup>(1)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Typically green or brown and well camouflaged</strong></span> on the plants among
      which they
      live, mantis lie in ambush or patiently
      stalk their quarry. <sup>(1)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>They use their front legs to snare their prey</strong></span> with reflexes so
      quick that
      they are difficult to see with the naked eye.
      Their legs are further equipped with spikes for snaring prey and pinning it in place.
      <sup>(1)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Their legs are further equipped with spikes</strong></span> for snaring prey and
      pinning it
      in place. <sup>(1)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>The morphology, or body plan, of a praying mantis</strong></span>, is similar to
      that of many
      insects. It has six legs, two wings, and
      two antennae. However, they have some special features which make them unique among insects.
      <sup>(21)</sup>
     </p>
     <p><span>First, <strong>they are able to turn their head around as humans can</strong></span>. All
      other
      insects cannot turn their heads, their neck is
      too rigid to allow it. <sup>(21)</sup></p>
     <p><span>Second,<strong> praying mantids have modified front legs</strong></span>; these front legs
      are
      specially designed to catch prey and hold them
      tightly. These arms are very strong and equipped with pointy spikes to keep a firm hold on the
      prey.
      <sup>(21)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Most adult praying mantids have wings</strong></span> (some species do not).
      Females usually
      cannot fly with their wings,<br> but males can. <sup>(21)</sup></p>
     <p><span>Camouflage and colors,<strong> Some mantis species depend on good camouflage to prevent
        predators</strong></span> from eating them, while others keep a more simple
      look. Well camouflaged mantids have many projections on their body in the shape of dead leaves,
      branches,
      flower petals,
      or even moss. <sup>(21)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Their colors can vary from</strong></span> brown to green, white, pink, yellow, or
      a mix of
      all colors. The more straightforwards looks
      are simply green, brown or sandy colored but without any special modifications. <sup>(21)</sup>
     </p>
     <p><span><strong>A praying mantis has 5 eyes</strong></span>, Yes, five eyes! You would think two
      would be
      enough, right? Not for a mantis! A mantis has
      to big compound eyes, the ones you will easily notice. But they also have three smaller eyes
      located in the
      middle of
      their head. Those eyes are used for detecting light while the big eyes are for seeing movement
      and having
      depth vision. <sup>(21)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Some mantis species have one ear located on their belly</strong></span>
      Five eyes but one ear? Mantises are crazy! Not every species of mantis has developed the power
      of hearing,
      but some did.
      The auditory organ of a mantis is located in the middle of their belly, just between the last
      set of legs.
      Their ear is
      nothing like ours, as it can only hear loud high-pitched noises. Other sounds can only be felt
      as vibrations
      but not as
      real hearing. <sup>(21)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Why would a mantis only want to hear loud high-pitched sounds
        ???</strong></span><br><br> To
      avoid
      bats!
      When
      a mantis flies it can be easy prey
      for bats. At night bats feed on any flying insect and spot them using echolocation.
      <sup>(21)</sup>
     <div title="How Bats Hunt Them" class="bats-hunt">click if you
      want know-how <div class="how-hunt tracking-in-expand-fwd">The bat will send out a high pitched
       cry and will
       listen for the sound
       bouncing off a flying
       insect and coming back to
       him. When a flying mantis hears a loud high-pitched sound it means that a bat is near. To
       avoid being
       eaten it
       will make
       a sudden move and allow itself to fall to the ground. Hopefully, the bat was not prepared
       for that move
       and will
       miss
       his prey.</div>

     <p>Moths, crickets, grasshoppers, flies, and other insects are usually the unfortunate recipients of
      unwanted
      mantid
      attention. However, <span><strong>the insects will also eat others of their own
        kind</strong></span>. The most
      famous example of this is the notorious
      mating behavior of the adult female, who sometimes eats her mate just after—or even
      during—mating.
      <span><strong>Yet this
        behavior
        seems not to deter males from reproduction</strong></span>. <sup>(1)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>The mating behavior of a praying mantis in the wild has been the subject of
        longstanding
        debate</strong></span> since the second half of
      the 19th century yet no convincing studies came to the fore. However, lately, scientists are
      beginning to take
      interest
      as to how mantids mate in the wild. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Adult mantis is known to mate probably in the first week of
        eclosion</strong></span>. Eclosion is
      a biological process in which the
      nymph turns into an adult. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>One of the females of S. Carolina copulates nearly</strong></span> five times after
      reaching
      adulthood. Sometimes a male mantid can
      copulate within just 30 hours following eclosion. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>For those mantids’ population that inhabits temperate habitats</strong></span>, the
      mating begins
      in August and ends in November. This
      includes mantis living in northern California, Maryland, and Portugal. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Mantis’ eggs however overwinter so they are
        hatched in April and June the following year.</strong></span> <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>In some parts of the world, adult male mantises survive</strong></span> all
      throughout the year,
      particularly in western Africa and Trinidad. The African mantis’ population appears to spend
      many months in
      mating. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Since male mantis does all the hard work such as</strong></span> looking for a
      female; following
      pheromones; and approaching her during
      the daytime, it’s logical to assume that mating occurs somewhere in the daylight hours.
      <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>For instance</span></strong>, the Mediterranean mantis (Iris oratoria) and Arizona
      mantis
      (Stagmomantis limbata) mount the female around
      1200 and 1800 hours. Scientists claim that these are peak mating hours for a praying mantis.
      <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>But, not all species mate at noon for there are some such as</strong></span> the
      South American
      dead leaf mantis (Acanthops falcata)
      that mate minutes after the first light of the day i.e. dawn. A few species are observed mating
      even on full-moon
      nights
      although it is too rare to occur. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>However, scientists do believe that since researchers have their own
        limitations</strong></span>
      that is they just can’t observe mantis
      mating at night that doesn’t mean all mantises are diurnal. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>The Mantis religiosa was once seen approaching the female after sunset.</strong></span>
      <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Worldwide, mantids will communicate their intentions to the mating partner in two main
        signals</strong></span>; visual, chemical. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Chemical signals involve discharging some kind of chemical to tempt the mating
        partner</strong></span>. The female mantids will release
      pheromones when she’s willing to mate. The male will find the female by following these pheromones.
      <sup>(99)</sup>
     </p>
     <p><span><strong>According to the scientists</strong></span>, the M. religiosa female attracts the male from
      as far
      a distance as 100 meters away. In
      species, where females are flightless and live a sedentary lifestyle the pheromones are going to be
      discharged
      from far off.
      <sup>(99)</sup>
     </p>
     <p><span><strong>Mantids just don’t rely on visual signals</strong></span> in an attempt to look for their
      mating
      partner.

     <p><span><strong>Praying mantids have as many senses as we do</strong></span>; sight, smell, taste, feeling,
      and
      hearing. However, they mostly depend on
      sight. Their sense of sight is amazing compared to the abilities of other insects. <sup>(21)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>They are one of the only kinds of insects that have stereo-vision</strong></span>; it can
      look
      with two eyes at the same spot making it
      possible to judge distances very accurately. Their other senses are weak compared to ours; their sense of
      smell is
      mostly limited to smelling specific pheromones that members of their own species emit. <sup>(21)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Their sense of hearing is weak but very special</strong></span> in the insect world. Almost
      all
      insects cannot hear as we do, they can
      only sense vibrations. <sup>(21)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>But praying mantids actually have one ear</strong></span>, in the middle of their abdomen,
      that
      can sense the high-pitched tones of a
      bat! This ear is especially developed to pick up the echolocation calls of bats, the ear cannot hear other
      tones.
      <sup>(21)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Because of this ear</strong></span>, a flying mantis can hear it when a bat is chasing him in
      the
      air. When a flying mantis hears the
      call of the bat at a close distance, it will suddenly make a turn and let itself drop to the ground. This
      saves
      the life
      of the mantis, as bats are a very common predator of flying insects. <sup>(21)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>They use their front legs to snare their</strong></span> prey with reflexes so quick that
      they are
      difficult to see with the naked eye.
      Their legs are further equipped with spikes for snaring prey and pinning it in place. <sup>(1)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Praying mantis isn’t only the deadliest of predators—it’s the most efficient
        too</strong></span>.
      Once it gets hold of the prey the
      victim is less likely to escape death. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>The praying mantis bites the head of the prey then</strong></span> followed by the rest of
      the
      body. This is the rule of thumb for
      eating lunch. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Even so, the female that eats the male during or after mating is thought</strong></span> to
      consume the male’s head first. If you happen
      to come across any headless male then it probably is the unlucky mating partner of a hungry female.
      <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>There might be a reason as to why mantises are adapted to beheading</strong></span> their
      mating
      partner even when they counter no
      threat. Earlier scientists thought that the ganglion occurs in the mantis’ abdomen (instead of the head) so
      removing the
      head possibly enhances fertilization. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>They believed that the cannibalizing behavior of a female</strong></span> could be one of the
      reproductive strategies. However, lately,
      researchers have rejected this phenomenon. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>They said that since the experiments are performed inside the laboratory</strong></span>
      (artificial environment)
      the mantis would not
      be able to demonstrate just the kind of behavior it does in the wild. Let us not forget that the praying
      mantis
      is
      extremely sensitive to any disturbance such as the lights. Mantids just can’t behave in the laboratory the
      way
      they do
      in the natural setting. <sup>(99)</sup><br><br>Therefore, scientists have yet to decide as to why praying
      mantis
      eats the head first.</p>

      <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>All the above rumors might have possibly originated from</strong></span> Ancient Egyptians
