     <h3>Honey Badger <span>(Ratel)</span></h3>
    </div>
    <div class="content" title="description">
     <p><span>Imagine an animal</span> with a weight not exceeding 20 kg and a high that does not
      normally reach 30 cm and can stand in
      front of lions. <sup>(100)</sup></p>
     <p>Some say <span>honey badgers don’t care</span>, but that reputation is hardly fair. In fact,
      these
      medium-sized members of the weasel
      family have super-sized attitudes. <sup>(1)</sup></p>
     <p>while <span>the Guinness World Records book refers to them as being the most fearless animal
       alive.</span>
      In fact, they’re so fierce
      that according to Dr. Dorothy Breed, they’ve been known to
      attack lions. Yet at only
      23-28cm high, 55-77cm long, and weighing in under 16kg, their size is not exactly daunting,
      and belies their fighting
      spirit. <sup>(18)</sup></p>

     <p>These creatures <span>are long-bodied</span>, with short legs and a broad girth. They have
      very loose and
      thick skin, giving them the
      ability to turn freely and fight when grabbed. <sup>(6)</sup></p>
     <p><span>They have long, coarse hair</span> that lacks an undercoat. The fur on their back is
      white or grey,
      and from the shoulders down
      they are black. <sup>(6)</sup></p>
     <p><span>Honey badgers have small eyes and ears.</span> Their ears are little more than small
      flaps of skin
      on the head. Having small
      eyes and ears equates to smaller targets when fighting. If your eyes are smaller, they are
      less likely to get gouged! <sup>(6)</sup></p>
     <p><span>Ratels have impressively thick skin</span>, particularly on their necks. In fact, the
      skin on the
      neck can be nearly 1/4 of an
      inch thick! Researchers believe that their tough hide developed as a result of heavy
      fighting amongst themselves. <sup>(6)</sup></p>
     <p>Another impressive feature of the <span>honey badger is their battle equipment.</span> Having
      a pair of
      powerful claws is important
      when ripping open beehives and digging up burrowing prey. They have long nails that can grow
      to nearly two inches long
      on the front paws. They use both tooth and nail when defending themselves from predators.
      <sup>(6)</sup></p>
     <p><span>Their prominent</span>, sharp teeth, long foreclaws, and stocky build allow them to
      easily rip meat
      from the bone. <sup>(1)</sup></p>
     <p><span>The sensitive or vulnerable areas</span> such as eyes, ears, and tail are very small,
      so they’re not as exposed. <sup>(3)</sup></p>

     <p><span>Ratels look more like a weasel</span> than they do a badger. <sup>(6)</sup></p>

     <p><span>Honey badgers</span>, also known as ratels, are <span>related to</span> skunks, otters,

     <p><span>These voracious omnivores get their name from their fondness</span> for feeding on
      honey and honeybee larvae. They also eat
      insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, as well as roots, bulbs, berries, and
      fruits. <sup>(1)</sup></p>
     <p><span>These predators are not particularly picky eaters.</span> They will consume just about
      anything that is edible, making them
      opportunistic feeders. As anyone with a sweet tooth will know, honey is delicious, and honey
      badgers agree!<br>While they enjoy hunting and tearing apart bees’ nests, it is definitely
      not the only thing
      they will feast on. Some of
      the items on their menu include rodents, birds, insects, reptiles, frogs, fruits,
      vegetables, and berries. <sup>(6)</sup></p>
     <p><span>Their bite is strong</span> enough to crack open a small tortoise. <sup>(3)</sup></p>
     <p><span>A study in South Africa</span> found that Honey Badgers have a very diverse diet. They
      eat at least 59 species! Right from bee
      larvae to 3 metre long pythons. <sup>(3)</sup></p>
     <p><span>Most of their prey is dug out but</span> gerbils, lizards, geckos, and snakes make up a
      lot of their diet. <sup>(3)</sup></p>
     <p><span>Interestingly, they also climb trees</span> like Goshawks, to eat raptor chickens.
      <sup>(3)</sup></p>
     <p><span>young Goshawks and Jackals fall prey</span> to adult Honey Badgers. <sup>(3)</sup></p>
     <p><span>They’re not really afraid of humans</span> and they like eating chickens and other
      livestock. <sup>(3)</sup></p>
     <p><span>They also have a tendency of surplus killing</span>, which means they’ll kill as many
      animals as they can, regardless of how
      many they can actually eat. So now you know the problem for chicken farmers! <sup>(3)</sup>
     </p>
     <p>Along with that, <span>they’re also very smart and strong</span>. They can easily get into
      enclosures and coops. <sup>(3)</sup></p>
     <p><span>They have also been observed eating young monkeys</span> and even deadly black mambas.
      <sup>(5)</sup></p>
     <p><span>Badgers eat a host of</span> smaller food items like insect larvae, beetles, scorpions,
      lizards, rodents, and birds. They will
      catch the larger reptiles like leguaans, crocodiles to 1 meter, and pythons to 3meters and
      include the highly venomous
      adders, cobras, and black mamba in their diet. Larger mammals like the Springhare, polecat,
      and particularly juvenile
      foxes, jackals, antelope, and wild cats, are also caught. <sup>(99)</sup></p>

     <p><span>Honey badgers can be found</span> throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa, Saudi Arabia,
      Iran, and western Asia. They can adapt
      to a variety of conditions, from warm rain forests to cool mountains. Their home ranges can
      be as vast as about 193
      square miles (500 square kilometers). <sup>(1)</sup></p>
     <p><span>The honey badger has an extensive historical range that extends</span> through most of
      sub-Saharan Africa from the Cape of Good
      Hope, South Africa, to southern Morocco and southwestern Algeria, and outside of Africa
      through Arabia, Iran, and

     <p><span>It lives in a wide variety of habitats</span> from the dense rain forests of Zaire to

     <p><span>Good at turning rock crevices and hollow trees into shelters</span>, honey badgers will
      also make homes in the abandoned dens
      of other animals like porcupines and yellow mongooses. <sup>(1)</sup></p>
     <p><span>Ratels are fans of dry habitats</span> where they can dig up burrowing creatures and
      tear open dried trees. They are also found
      in forests as well as grasslands. They use their powerful front claws to dig a long burrow
      to sleep and bear their
      young. With such a quarrelsome animal it should be no surprise that they are more than
      willing to steal the burrows of
      other creatures! <sup>(6)</sup></p>
     <p><span>Honey Badgers are amazing diggers</span>, but their burrows are usually just about
      three meters long. They sometimes even use
      Aardvark or Groundhog burrows. <sup>(3)</sup></p>

     <p><span>Honey Badgers have a reversible anal pouch.</span> That means it can be pushed out of
      the anus. It smells so bad that it is
      believed they use it to tranquilize bees when they’re looking for honey. <sup>(1)</sup></p>
     <p><span>Surprisingly</span>, these solitary predators do not have strictly defended
      territories. Instead, their territories have more
      loose boundaries, allowing them to interact at favorite foraging spaces. They will fight
      amongst one another, and their
      deep growl can be incredibly ominous. When females are ready to breed they will dig a
      nursery chamber in their den. <sup>(6)</sup></p>
     <p><span>Historically</span>, the Honey Badger has been believed to have a mutualistic
      relationship with a small bird, the Honey Guide.<br>
      The birds are really good at finding bee nests, but can’t break into them.<br> So according
      to the myth the birds call Honey
      Badgers with a distinctive song and wait until it breaks open the nest.<br>But there’s no
      actual evidence of this happening.<br> It’s all hearsay and old folklore.<br> The bird does
      however
      have a
      mutualistic relationship with humans. <sup>(3)</sup></p>
     <p><span>In zoos</span>, honey badgers require a habitat with plenty of tunneling area or
      simulated burrows. They need lots of hiding
      places, and false burrows with viewing windows can be quite useful. <sup>(6)</sup></p>
     <p><span>Honey Badgers are solitary animals</span> but might spend some time with a mate during
      mating season. <sup>(3)</sup></p>
     <p><span>Outside of the mating season</span>, most encounters between Honey Badgers are
      uncommon, unwelcome, and violent. <sup>(3)</sup></p>
     <p><span>But since they don’t like seeing each other</span>, they have evolved a sophisticated
      system
      of chemical communication.<br> They
      leave urine, feces, and skin secretions in conspicuous places for others to find.
      <sup>(3)</sup></p>
     <p><span>They also have anal glands</span> that secrete a musky substance, which is a sign of
      aggression, fear, and threat. <sup>(3)</sup></p>
     <p><span>They’re one of the mammals to use tools.</span> <a
       href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZyjKF31_JQ&ab_channel=NatureonPBS">In this
       video</a>, you can see it rolling a log to make a step stool to reach the
      bird’s nest. <sup>(3)</sup></p>
     <p><span>There’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c36UNSoJenI&ab_channel=BBC">also this
        video</a></span>, it uses a bunch of different tools to escape its zoo enclosure.
      <sup>(3)</sup></p>
     <p><span>They can also dig</span> a hole big enough for them to hide in just minutes!
      <sup>(3)</sup></p>
     <p><span>Baby honey badgers are born blind</span>, hairless, and helpless. Mothers raise their
      cubs alone and carry them to new burrows
      every few days.<br><span>The eyes of cubs only open after two months</span>, but they still
      stay with
      their
      mothers for protection and
      the opportunity to learn important survival skills.<br><span>The young honey badgers only
       leave
       after</span>
      they reach 14 months of
      age, sometimes even up to two years. <sup>(5)</sup></p>
     <p><span>Despite being solitary, honey badgers have a social hierarchy. <sup>(5)</sup></span>
     </p>
     <p><span>Male honey badgers occupy</span> larger territories than females, and overlapping does
      occur. <sup>(5)</sup>
     </p>
     <p>and males can <span>sometimes travel</span> in groups to search for mates. Dominant honey
      badgers can sometimes chase away the
      non-dominant males from mating burrows. <sup>(5)</sup>
     </p>
     <p><span>Genetic analysis also reveals that</span> dominant males father around half of the cubs
      in a given area. <sup>(5)</sup>

     <p><span>Honey badger is listed</span> as Near Threatened in the most recent South African Red
      Data List (2002). <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span>In the Cape provinces of South Africa</span>, badgers are a schedule 2 protected wild
      animal (Nature & Environmental
      Conservation Ordinance, 1974; a permit is required to kill or move honey badger), but they
      are essentially unprotected
      outside of game reserves and national parks in other provinces of South Africa (Rowe-Rowe
      1992). <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span>In the Western Cape, South Africa</span> half of 82 commercial beekeepers surveyed
      admitted to killing honey badgers despite
      their protected status (Begg 2001a). <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span>In Morocco</span>, honey badgers are protected by law, and the species is considered
      Near Threatened due to the nonselective
      use of poison and traps. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span>In Niger</span>, the honey badger is said to be Endangered and <span>in Saudi
       Arabia</span>, they are considered to be rare. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span>In India</span> the honey badger is listed in Schedule I, Part I of the Indian Wildlife
      (Protection) Act, 1972.
      <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span>Apart from man</span>, the honey badger is considered the most destructive mammalian
      predator of honeybees in Africa, and
      conflict between beekeepers and the honey badger has been recorded throughout their range.
      <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span>They are also frequently inadvertently killed</span> by the non-selective use of
      poisons and gin traps that are used to kill
      other animals of a similar size i.e. caracal Felis caracal and black-backed jackal.
      <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span>Outside of protected areas</span> the honey badger is also actively persecuted by small

     <p><span>they are killed for</span> traditional medicine and their pelts appear for sale in
      traditional markets in South Africa,
      Mozambique, Malawi, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe fear because of their reputation formlessness
      and tenacity. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span>They also appear on the bushmeat trade</span> in some countries although local hunters
      agree they don't make good eating and
      are only eaten when other more favored bushmeat animals are no longer available
      <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span>In addition</span>, their elusive nature means that honey badger populations could
      easily reach critically low levels without
      nature conservation authorities being aware of the problem. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span>Their body parts</span> (particularly paws, skin, fat, and organs) are commonly used in
      traditional medicine because of their
      reputation for fearlessness and tenacity. In some areas (Zambia, Guinea), they appear in the
      bushmeat trade because of
      the decline in other more favored bushmeat species. <sup>(3)</sup></p>
     <p><span>Apiculturists build</span> their beehives at a height of at least one meter, and on
      smooth posts that are impossible for ratels
      to climb. <sup>(3)</sup></p>
     <p><span>The bottom line is that</span> although honey badgers are widespread and considered
      abundant, they are hunted or persecuted in
      certain areas, especially when they conflict with farmers and beekeepers. They are also
      eaten as bushmeat and harvested
      for the traditional medicine trade; A reputation for courage and perseverance makes honey
      badger popular in traditional
      medicine.

     <p><span>Due to their large space requirements</span>, viable populations of honey badgers are
      unlikely to be contained within the smaller protected areas.<br> Their biological
      features of small litter size (1-2 cubs) and an extended period of dependence on their
      mothers may make honey badgers
      particularly vulnerable to local extinctions in unprotected areas. <sup>(99)</sup></p>

     <p><span>In a gland at the base of its tail</span>, the honey badger stores a stinky liquid just
      as
      powerful as a skunk's. <sup>(9)</sup></p>
     <p><span>Honey badger males</span> span are at least a third bigger than females. <sup>(9)</sup></p>
     <p><span>Honey badgers seem</span> to be resistant to snake venom. <sup>(9)</sup></p>

      quills, and even dog bites! <sup>(9)</sup>
