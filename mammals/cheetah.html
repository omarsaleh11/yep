     <p><span><strong>An animal with a well-deserved speed</strong></span>, agility, and endurance. But
      it certainly lacks
      power and control (prestige). <sup>(100)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>The cheetah is the world's fastest land mammal</strong></span>. With acceleration
      that would leave
      most automobiles in the dust, a
      cheetah can go from 0 to 60 miles an hour in only three seconds. These big cats are quite nimble
      at high speed and can
      make quick and sudden turns in pursuit of prey. <sup>(1)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>you ever get to see a cheetah run</strong></span>, don’t blink, you’ll miss it.
      cause cheetah are synonymous with speed. <sup>(3)</sup></p>

    <div class="content" title="description">
     <p>These cats <span><strong>are lean and lanky,</strong></span> allowing them to reach incredible
      speeds. They have tan-colored fur with solid black,
      round spots. They have very long legs, a long narrow tail for balance, and a deep chest that
      contains large lungs. <sup>(6)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Cheetahs have round ears</strong></span>, and black markings running from the
      inside of the eye to the corner of the mouth, this pattern
      gives a “running makeup” look to the face. <sup>(6)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>King of Speed</strong></span> – You can’t have an article about cheetahs without
      talking about their incredible speed. Cheetahs are the
      fastest land animals, These predators can run up to 70 mph in short bursts! The fastest human
      ever recorded ran a measly
      22 mph. <sup>(6)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>King of Color</strong></span> – Similar to the case with black panthers, cheetahs
      are capable of having unique coat patterns. One
      pattern, referred to as a “King Cheetah,” has three dark stripes along the back, and large,
      blotchy spots. The gene
      responsible for this coloration is the same gene that determines color patterns in domestic
      tabby cats! <sup>(6)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>King of the Daylight</strong></span> – Because cheetahs are lightweight and
      fragile, they do not compete well with other big cats.
      Cheetahs share a range with many other predators. To avoid conflict and dangerous interactions,
      cheetahs hunt during the
      day. Most other large predators hunt at night, allowing cheetahs are able to avoid danger and
      competition. <sup>(6)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Before unleashing their speed</strong></span>, cheetahs use exceptionally keen
      eyesight to scan their grassland environment for signs of
      prey. This big cat is a daylight hunter that benefits from stealthy movement and a distinctive
      spotted coat that allows
      it to blend easily into high, dry grasses. <sup>(1)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Adult cheetahs’ weight averages</strong></span> between 75 and 125 pounds. They can
      measure from 40 to 60 inches in length, measured
      from the head to the hindquarters. The tail can add a further 24 to 32 inches bringing the total
      overall length up to
      7.5 feet. On average, cheetahs stand 28 to 36 inches tall at the shoulder. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>The cheetah is a sexually dimorphic species</strong></span> though it is difficult
      to identify cheetahs’ sex by appearance alone. Male
      cheetahs are slightly bigger than females and they have larger heads. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Cheetahs have a thin frame with a narrow waist</strong></span> and a deep chest.
      They have large nostrils that allow for increased
      oxygen intake. Cheetahs have large lungs and hearts connected to a circulatory system with
      strong arteries and adrenals
      that work in tandem to circulate oxygen through their blood very efficiently. <sup>(99)</sup>
     </p>
     <p><span><strong>With its long legs and very slender body</strong></span>, the cheetah is quite
      different from all other cats and is the only member of
      its genus, Acinonyx. The cheetah’s unique morphology and physiology allow it to attain the
      extreme speeds for which it’s
      famous. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>The cheetah’s undercoat ranges in color from</strong></span> light tan to deep gold
      and is marked by solid black spots. These spots are
      not open like the rosettes found on a leopard or jaguar’s coat, which is one way to quickly
      identify the cheetah. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Distinctive black tear stripes run from the eyes</strong></span> to the mouth. The
      stripes are thought to protect the eyes from the
      sun’s glare. It is believed that they have the same function as a rifle scope, helping cheetahs
      focus on their prey at a
      long-distance range by minimizing the glare of the sun.<sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Cheetah tails end with a bushy tuft encircled by</strong></span> five or six dark
      rings. These markings provide them with excellent
      camouflage while hunting and make them more difficult for other predators to detect. The tail is
      also thought to be a
      signaling device, helping young cubs follow their mothers in tall grass. The tip of the tail
      varies in color from white
      to black among individuals.<sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong> At top speed</strong></span>,
      their stride is seven meters long. The cheetah’s unique body structure: flexible spine,
      semi-retractable claws, long
      legs, and tail allow it to achieve an unbelievable top speed of 110 km/hr (70 mph). The
      cheetah’s body is narrow and
      lightweight with long slender limbs. Specialized muscles allow for a greater swing to the limbs
      increasing acceleration. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Cheetahs’ footpads are hard</strong></span> and less rounded than the other cats.
      The pads function like tire treads providing them with
      increased traction in fast, sharp turns. The short blunt claws, which are considered
      semi-retractable, are closer to
      that of a dog than of other cats. The claws work like the cleats of a track shoe to grip the
      ground for traction when
      running to help increase speed.<sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>The flexibility of the cheetah’s spine is unique</strong></span>. The cheetah’s
      long muscular tail works like a rudder, stabilizing, and
      acting as a counterbalance to its body weight. Swinging the tailback and forth continually
      adjusting to the movement of
      prey allows for sudden sharp turns during high-speed chases. The cheetah’s shoulder blade does
      not attach to the collar
      bone, thus allowing the shoulders to move freely.<sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>The hips pivot to allow the rear legs to stretch far apart when the body is fully
        extended</strong></span>. The hip and shoulder
      extension allows for a large range of extension during running, thus making both its exceptional
      stride length. The
      length between their steps is six to seven meters (21 ft) and four strides are completed per
      second. There are two times
      in one stride when the cheetah’s body is completely off the ground: once when all four legs are
      extended and once when
      all four legs are bunched under the body.<sup>(99)</sup></p>

     <p><span><strong>The prey species on which the cheetah depends have evolved</strong></span> speed
      and avoidance techniques that can keep them just out of
      reach. Cheetahs prey includes gazelles (especially Thomson’s gazelles), impalas, and other small
      to medium-sized
      antelopes, hares, birds, and rodents. Cheetahs will also prey on the calves of larger herd
      animals. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Cheetahs generally prefer to prey upon wild species and avoid</strong></span>
      hunting domestic livestock. The exception happening in
      sick, injured, and either old or young and inexperienced cheetahs. Generally, the livestock
      animals that are lost to
      predation by cheetahs are also sick, injured, and old/young. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p>Because cheetahs are light and lean, <span><strong>they typically hunt smaller
        prey</strong></span> than other big cats. Their prey is usually between
      51 and 123 lbs. and mostly consists of mammals. Some common prey species include gazelles,
      blesbok, springbok, duiker,
      and impala. Groups of cheetahs will occasionally bring down larger prey. <sup>(6)</sup></p>

     <p><span><strong>At birth, the cubs weigh</strong></span> 8.5 to 15 ounces and are blind and
      helpless. Their mother will groom them patiently, purring
      quietly and providing them warmth and security. After a day or so, the mother will leave the
      cubs to hunt for herself,
      so she can continue to care for the cubs. This is the most vulnerable time for the cubs, as they
      are left unprotected.
      They will live in a secluded nest until they are about six to eight weeks old, being regularly
      moved by their mother
      from nest to nest to avoid detection by predators. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>At about six weeks of age</strong></span> The cubs begin following their mother on
      her daily travels as she is looking for prey. During these first few months,
      she cannot move far or fast and cub mortality is highest. Fewer than one in 10 cubs will survive
      during this time, as
      they perish from predation by other large predators such as lions and hyenas, or from injuries.
      This is the time when
      life skills are taught. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Cheetah cubs have a thick silvery-grey mantle down their back</strong></span>. The
      mantle helps camouflage the cubs by imitating the
      look of an aggressive animal called a <a href="./honey-badger.html">honey badger</a>. This
      mimicry may help deter predators such as lions, hyenas, and
      eagles from attempting to kill them. Cubs lose their mantle at about three months of age.
      <sup>(99)(3)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Between four to six months of age</strong></span> Cheetah cubs are very active and
      playful. Trees provide good observation points and
      allow for the development of skills in balancing. The cubs’ semi non-retractable claws are
      sharper at this age and help
      them grip the tall ‘play trees’ they climb with their siblings.
      <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Learning to hunt is the most critical survival skill</strong></span> that the cubs
      will develop. At one year of age, cheetah cubs
      participate in hunts with their mother.
      <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>At about 18 months of age</strong></span> The mother and cubs will finally
      separate. Although not fully adept at hunting on their own, independent male and female
      cubs will stick together for a few more months to master their hunting skills. When the
      adolescent females begin
      cycling, dominant males will court them and drive their brothers away.

     <p>Unlike other “big cats”, <span><strong>cheetahs don’t roar</strong></span>. They growl
      when facing danger, and they vocalize with sounds more
      equivalent to a high-pitched chirp or bubble and they bark when communicating with each other.
      The cheetah can also purr
      while both inhaling and exhaling. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>they cannot sustain a high-speed chase for very long</strong></span>. They must
      catch their prey in 30 seconds or less as they cannot
      maintain maximum speeds for much longer. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Cheetahs spend most of their time sleeping</strong></span> and they are minimally
      active during the hottest portions of the day. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Female cheetahs typically have a litter of three cubs</strong></span> and live with
      them for one and a half to two years. Young cubs
      spend their first year learning from their mother and practicing hunting techniques with playful
      games. <sup>(1)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Male cheetahs live alone or in small groups</strong></span>, often with their
      littermates. <sup>(1)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Cheetahs live in groups of mothers and their young</strong></span>. Once the young
      are independent adult females, they become largely
      solitary. <sup>(6)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Males are territorial</strong></span>, but will live in groups of animals called
      “coalitions.” The males establish large territories
      together to allow the greatest likelihood of encountering females. Females are not territorial.
      <sup>(6)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Cheetahs are visual hunters</strong></span>. Cheetahs climb ‘play trees’ or termite
      mounds to get an optimal vantage point for spotting
      prey against the horizon. The hunt has several components. It includes prey detection, stalking,
      the chase, tripping (or
      prey capture), and killing by means of suffocation bite to the throat. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Solitary individuals are generally semi-nomadic</strong></span> and may occupy
      large ranges of land that overlap with the territories of
      other cheetahs. A solitary male rarely holds onto a territory against a coalition of cheetahs.
      <sup>(20)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Nonterritorial males are nomadic</strong></span>, typically an adolescent can cover
      a large amount a ground quickly and rarely remain in
      an area for more than a few days. <sup>(20)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>The cheetah serves a special role in its ecosystem</strong></span>. Cheetahs are
      one of the most successful hunters on the savanna but
      their kills are very often stolen by larger carnivores or predators that hunt in groups. They
      keep prey species healthy by killing the weak and old

     <p><span><strong>Most wild cheetahs are found in</strong></span> eastern and southwestern Africa.
      These populations are under pressure as the wide-open
      grasslands they favor are disappearing at the hands of human settlers. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Population research has shown that</strong></span> when habitat is destroyed and
      populations become fragmented and isolated, the rate of
      inbreeding increases and the genetic diversity lowers. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Physiological impairments such as poor sperm quality</strong></span>, focal
      palatine erosion, susceptibility to infectious diseases, and
      kinked tails are a result of low genetic diversity within both the wild and captive cheetah
      population. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Relatives of the modern cheetah had</strong></span> worldwide distribution until
      about 20,000 years ago when the world’s environment
      underwent dramatic changes during the Great Ice Age. Only a handful of individuals remained.
      <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>The population of cheetahs rebounded</strong></span>. Up until ~10,000 years ago,
      their range spread across the entire African continent
      (minus the Congo Basin and the Sahara Desert) and into Asia from the Arabian Peninsula to
      eastern India. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Today, cheetahs are found in only 9%</strong></span> of their historic range and
      are functionally extinct. Once found throughout Asia
      and Africa, today there are fewer than 7,100 adult and adolescent cheetahs in the wild.
      <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Currently, cheetahs are listed as</strong></span> Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.
      In Namibia, they are a protected species. Under the
      Endangered Species Act in the United States, they are considered Endangered. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) lists them
        as</strong></span> Appendix 1 species. Most wild cheetahs
      exist in fragmented populations in pockets of Africa, occupying a mere 9 percent of their
      historic range. In Iran, fewer
      than 50 Asiatic cheetahs (a sub-species) remain. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>The largest single population of cheetahs</strong></span> occupies a six-country
      polygon that spans Namibia, Botswana, South Africa,
      Angola, Mozambique, and Zambia. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Unlike other large cats and pack predators</strong></span>, cheetahs do not do well
      in wildlife reserves. These areas normally contain
      high densities of other larger predators like the lion, leopard, and hyena. Predators such as
      these, compete with
      cheetahs for prey and will even kill cheetahs given the opportunity. In such areas, the cheetah
      cub mortality can be as
      high as 90%. Therefore, roughly 90% of cheetahs in Africa live outside of protected lands on
      private farmlands and thus
      often come into conflict with people. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>When a predator threatens a farmer’s livestock</strong></span>, they also threaten
      the farmer’s livelihood. Farmers act quickly to
      protect their resources, often trapping or shooting the cheetah. Because cheetahs hunt more
      during the day, they are
      seen more often than the nocturnal predators which contributes to a higher rate of persecution
      on the cheetah. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Habitat Loss</strong></span>, Cheetahs require vast expanses of land with suitable
      prey, water, and cover sources to survive. As
      wildlands are destroyed and fragmented by human expansion occurring all over the world, the
      cheetah’s available habitat
      is also destroyed. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Available habitat is fragmented and degraded</strong></span> reducing the number of
      animals an area can support. Numerous landscapes
      across Africa that could once support thousands of cheetahs now struggle to support just a
      handful. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Illegal Wildlife Trade,</strong></span> In many parts of the world, there are
      strong cultural associations for keeping cheetahs as companions. There is a long
      history of the practice and it is commonly seen in ancient art. <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>In contemporary times</strong></span>, cheetahs are still viewed as status symbols.
      Though cheetah ownership and exotic pet ownership
      has been outlawed in many countries, there is still a high demand for cheetahs as pets.
      <sup>(99)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Humans have been chipping away at cheetahs’ habitats for decades</strong></span>.
      Urbanization and land development displaces animals
      and reduces the amount of prey available. This has caused a significant decline in cheetah
      populations throughout the
      20th century. <sup>(6)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Cheetahs have been restricted to a tiny portion of their natural
        range</strong></span>. In fact, they have been eliminated from 89% of
      their historic range. <sup>(6)</sup></p>
     <p><span><strong>Unfortunately, this also causes additional, direct, human conflict</strong></span>.
      Livestock is slow, fat, and easy to catch. Cheetahs
      and other big cats will frequently hunt livestock, resulting in intense hatred from ranchers and
      farmers. When livestock
      is killed, farmers will hunt any cats in the area and kill them. <sup>(6)</sup></p>

     <p><span><strong>Namibia has the largest number of individuals of any country</strong></span>,

     <p><span><strong>To try and combat the decline from both indirect and direct human
